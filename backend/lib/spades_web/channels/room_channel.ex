  notify_from_outside/1: Tell everyone in the channel to send a message
  asking for a state update.
  This used to broadcast game state to everyone, but game state can contain
  private information.  So we tell everyone to ask for an update instead. Since
  we're over a websocket, the extra cost shouldn't be that bad.

  Note 1: After making this, I found a Phoenix Channel mechanism that lets
  you intercept and change outgoing messages.  That might be better.
  Note 2: "Outside" here means a caller from anywhere in the system can call
  this, unlike "notify".
